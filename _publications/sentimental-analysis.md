In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving technology, we have been using online communications as a part of our daily
life, allowing us to connect, share, and express ourselves. However, it also leads to concerning issues about toxic
and harmful language online. This reduces the quality of online discussions, affecting a person psychologically and
emotionally.
This project aims to use sentimental analysis to solve such problems. Traditional sentimental analysis
focuses on classifying content into emotional categories such as positive, negative, and neutral. However, this
project will use sentimental analysis and natural language processing (NLP) technology to create a model that is
able to detect the toxicity of a text.
In addition to that, this project also aims to explore the different approaches toward sentimental analysis
which includes neural network, logistic regression, and Bert & Transformer. We will be implementing these
different models with the same dataset in order to compare the efficiency of each model and choose the most
suitable model for toxicity detection.
