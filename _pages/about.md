# Welcome to Pichyapa’s Academic Portfolio

Passionate about technology, design, and education, I strive to bridge the gap between engineering and user experience. As a Computer Engineering student at King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) with a 4-year full scholarship, my journey has been shaped by hands-on experience, global exposure, and a deep commitment to continuous learning. From leading full-stack development projects to mentoring students in UX/UI design, my work revolves around crafting impactful, user-centered solutions.

My academic journey extends beyond the classroom, including a semester exchange in Canada under the SEED Scholarship and participation in various international programs. Alongside my studies, I’ve worked as a UI Engineer and Developer Advocate, collaborating with teams to build scalable web applications and enhance developer experience. I believe that great technology is not just about functionality—it’s about creating seamless interactions that empower users.

Beyond engineering, I am an advocate for community-driven innovation, actively contributing to tech events, hackathons, and open-source projects. This website showcases my academic achievements, projects, and experiences that reflect my passion for problem-solving and innovation. Whether you're an employer, a fellow developer, or someone who shares a curiosity for technology, I invite you to explore my work and connect with me.
